# BidPhase TODO

## SaaS Multi-User Upgrade (v4.0)

- [x] Upgrade project to full-stack (database + auth + backend server)
- [x] Design and implement 10-table database schema for multi-user isolation
- [x] Add passwordHash and emailVerified fields to users table
- [x] Build email/password signup procedure (bcrypt, session cookie)
- [x] Build email/password login procedure (timing-safe comparison)
- [x] Build logout procedure
- [x] Build change-password procedure
- [x] Wire all feature routers (auth, projects, data) into main appRouter
- [x] Build server-side db.ts helpers for all 10 tables
- [x] Build AuthGuard component (shows LoginPage when unauthenticated)
- [x] Build LoginPage with email/password form, signup/login toggle, show/hide password
- [x] Build DataConnectorsPanel with 3 tabs: Materials DB, Labor Standards, API Connectors
- [x] Materials DB tab: CSV/JSON upload, column normalization, bulk import, clear all, preview table
- [x] Labor Standards tab: JSON-based profile editor, create/edit/delete profiles, default flag
- [x] API Connectors tab: Platt/Rexel/WESCO/generic REST, API key storage, connection test
- [x] Add AccountSection to SettingsTab (signed-in user display + sign out button)
- [x] Copyright audit: update electricalDatabase.ts header to clarify original authorship
- [x] Remove all NECA Column 1 inline comments, replace with "original estimate"
- [x] Write vitest tests for email/password auth (signup, login, logout) — 7 tests pass
- [x] Dual-mode Assembly/Item estimate engine (from previous session)
- [x] 28 pre-built electrical assemblies seeded into electricalDatabase.ts

## Pending / Future

- [ ] Replace fractional resize recentering with true page-box centering in the PDF viewer
- [ ] Ensure the PDF canvas stays fully within the left pane as the divider moves
- [ ] Connect estimate engine to user's custom materials DB (fall back to built-in DB)
- [ ] Connect estimate engine to user's active labor standard profile
- [ ] Save estimate sessions to DB (currently frontend-only)
- [ ] Project management UI (create/rename/archive projects from the sidebar)
- [ ] Stripe subscription billing (free trial → paid tier)
- [ ] Email verification flow
- [ ] Password reset via email
- [ ] Admin dashboard for user management

## Bug Fixes & UI Polish (v4.1)

- [x] Login page: clean up clunky layout, fix overlapping lines, polish visual design
- [x] Login page: remove lightning bolt icon, show only "BidPhase" text
- [x] Login page: enforce strong password requirements (min 8 chars, uppercase, number, special char) with visual indicator
- [x] Default project state: remove pre-seeded jobs, show "New Project" placeholder when no projects exist
- [x] Projects: always allow deleting down to zero (no minimum project count enforced)
- [x] Sidebar navigation: allow toggling between Residential/Commercial/Industrial/Infrastructure from inside a workspace
- [x] Scale enforcement: require scale to be set before any measuring is allowed
- [x] Scale display: fix false "Scale set" message showing before scale is actually configured
- [x] Measure/Run sync: synchronize the measure and run controls at the top of the page
- [x] Unit count dropdown (right panel): fix so it works independently — should not require clicking the top toolbar button
