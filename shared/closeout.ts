/**
 * What the job actually took, against what the bid said it would.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The productivity factor (CLAUDE.md § Company defaults) is the one number in
 * this app that says "our crews against book hours", and until now the only way
 * to set it was a guess or a licensed reference table. Close-out is where real
 * field data gets in: a contractor records the hours a finished job took, and
 * the difference between that and the estimate is evidence about their own
 * crews on their own work.
 *
 * ── Optional, always ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Nothing in the app requires a close-out. A bid without one prices, proposes,
 * exports and archives exactly as it did before this existed — the feature adds
 * a record beside the bid and changes nothing about it. That is a design
 * constraint rather than a nicety: a contractor who never closes a job out must
 * not find the app degraded, or they will not adopt the part that matters.
 *
 * ── The estimate is frozen at close-out ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Comparison figures are snapshotted the moment the job is closed out, the same
 * rule every other layer of this app follows. Re-deriving the estimate later
 * would mean editing an assembly silently rewrites history — and the history is
 * the whole asset here. A closed-out job is a measurement, and a measurement
 * that changes when you adjust the instrument is not one.
 *
 * ── Suggestions are evidence, never an action ───────────────────────────────
 * If an assembly consistently runs over, this produces a SUGGESTION. It never
 * writes to the library. That follows the pattern the alias suggestions and the
 * plan co-pilot already use, and the reason is the same: the app is inferring
 * from a handful of jobs, and the estimator knows things the data does not —
 * that three of those jobs were the same difficult building, that the apprentice
 * was new, that the fourth was a favour done at a run. Auto-applying would move
 * every future bid in the company on a pattern nobody agreed to.
