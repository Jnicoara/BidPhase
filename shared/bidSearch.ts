/**
 * Finding a bid from years ago, out of thousands.
 *
 * ── Server-side, keyset-paginated, and why that is not over-engineering ──────
 * The tempting build is to fetch every bid and filter in the browser. It works
 * beautifully at 24 bids, which is what a developer has, and falls over at the
 * scale a real contractor reaches after a few years — by which point the fix is
 * a rewrite of the screen rather than a change to a query.
 *
 * Two decisions carry the weight:
 *
 *   FILTERING IN SQL. The database returns a page, never a table. Nothing here
 *   loads a list into Node to `.filter()` it.
 *
 *   KEYSET PAGINATION, not OFFSET. `LIMIT 20 OFFSET 10000` makes the database
 *   walk and discard ten thousand rows to hand back twenty; the deeper you
 *   page, the slower it gets, which is exactly backwards from what a person
 *   scrolling expects. A cursor says "the row after this one", so page 500
 *   costs what page 1 costs. It also cannot skip or repeat a row when
 *   something is inserted mid-scroll, which OFFSET does silently.
 *
 * ── The sort key must never be NULL ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * Keyset pagination compares `(sortValue, id)` against the cursor. A NULL sort
 * value has no position in that ordering, so rows with one would be dropped or
 * repeated depending on the direction. `dueDate` is nullable, so it is
 * available as a FILTER and deliberately not as a SORT. `createdAt` and
 * `updatedAt` are both NOT NULL and are the only sorts offered.
 *
 * ── Client identity lives in two places, and search has to read both ────────
 * A bid names its client as free text (`bids.clientName`) and/or by link
 * (`bids.clientId`), and `shared/bidClient.ts` resolves the two. Searching only
 * the text would miss every bid that carries just the link — which is every bid
 * created through the client picker. So the client and address filters match
 * either source. Getting this wrong produces a search that looks like it works
 * and quietly cannot find half the bids.
