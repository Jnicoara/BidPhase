/**
 * The guard in front of removing a bid.
 *
 * These exist because an audit found the two places that remove a bid
 * disagreeing: the Dashboard asked for confirmation, the Bids list archived on
 * a single click of a trash can. The wording and the confirm/cancel decision
 * now live in one module, and these pin both halves of what that module
 * promises:
 *
 *   • nothing but an explicit confirmation can produce an archive instruction;
 *   • the prompt says where the bid goes and how long it can be recovered.
 *
 * What these do NOT cover: that the component actually calls
 * `resolveArchiveAnswer` rather than the mutation directly. This repo tests
 * decisions rather than DOM (CLAUDE.md § Editing fields), so that wiring was
 * verified in the browser instead — see the commit message.
