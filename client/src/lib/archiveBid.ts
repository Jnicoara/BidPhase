/**
 * The guard in front of removing a bid, and what it says.
 *
 * ── Why this is a module and not just a dialog ───────────────────────────────
 * Removing a bid is offered from two places — the Dashboard board and the Bids
 * list — and an audit found them disagreeing: the Dashboard asked first, the
 * Bids list archived on a single click of a trash can. One of them had been
 * built before the archive existed and never revisited.
 *
 * Two copies of a safety prompt is how that happens. The wording and the
 * request→confirm step both live here so a third caller cannot invent a
 * quieter version of either.
 *
 * ── Archive, never delete ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * There is deliberately no hard-delete path for a bid anywhere in the app. This
 * asks to ARCHIVE, `bids.archive` is what it calls, and the copy says so —
 * a dialog that threatens deletion for something recoverable teaches people to
 * fear a safe action, which is its own kind of wrong.
 *
 * Permanent deletion exists only in the Archive screen, only for something
 * already archived, and the server refuses it otherwise.
