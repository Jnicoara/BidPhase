 * The two prompts in front of removing a library item.

 * ── Two steps, said differently on purpose ───────────────────────────────────
 * Archiving is reversible and Delete forever is not, so the two dialogs are
 * deliberately not variations on one another:
 *
 *   Archive        neutral wording, default button, says where it goes and
 *                  that nothing is lost. It is a safe action and should not
 *                  read as a dangerous one.
 *   Delete forever destructive styling, says plainly that it cannot be undone,
 *                  and offers the safer alternative in the same breath.
 *
 * Dressing them alike is how people learn to click through both without
 * reading, which costs them the one that matters.
 *
 * Shared by Materials, Assemblies, Kits and Modifiers so the wording cannot
 * drift between screens.
