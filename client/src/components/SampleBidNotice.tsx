/**
 * The banner on the sample bid itself.
 *
 * ── Why a banner here and only a badge elsewhere ─────────────────────────────
 * On a list, a badge is enough: the row sits beside real ones and the contrast
 * does the work. Inside the bid there is nothing to contrast against — the
 * screen is identical to a real bid's, which is exactly the property that makes
 * the sample useful and exactly what makes forgetting easy. So this one says it
 * in a sentence rather than a word.
 *
 * It says three things in the order a person needs them: what this is, that
 * editing it is safe, and how to be rid of it. The middle one is the one that
 * unlocks the feature — a user who is not sure whether they are allowed to
 * touch it will not touch it, and a sample nobody edits teaches nothing.
