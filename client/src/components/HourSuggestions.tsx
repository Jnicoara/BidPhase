/**
 * "This assembly keeps running long — adjust it?"
 *
 * ── It lives where the change would land ─────────────────────────────────────
 * On the Assemblies library, not on the bid that produced the evidence. The
 * suggestion is about the library, the accept button edits the library, and a
 * card that offers to change something the user cannot see is a card they
 * cannot judge.
 *
 * ── Accept, dismiss, or leave it ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three outcomes and no default. Nothing here is pre-selected, nothing times
 * out into an action, and closing the page changes nothing — the same
 * suggest-then-confirm shape the alias suggestions use. Dismissing is
 * remembered, so a contractor who knows why those three jobs ran long is not
 * asked again every time another one closes out.
 *
 * ── It states its evidence ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * How many jobs, and how far off. A suggestion a person cannot check is one
 * they either accept blindly or ignore entirely, and both are worse than the
 * number they already had.
